/*
    types of containers::
        1. sequence containers
        2. associative containers
        3. Derived containers

    1. sequence containers :: store data in linear fashsion   
    (example : vector, list, dequeue)

    2.Associative containers ::  direct access (set , multi set,multi map , map ) for fast searching

    3. Derived containers :: real world modeling (exmaple :: stack, queue, priority queue)



    when to use which ??
Sequence containers:::
    1. vector --> random access is fast, but insertion or deletion in middle is relatively slow,isertion and deletion at the end is fast
    2. List -->structured as array of two element array with   one element and another is a pointer ,random access is slow , insertion and deletion at middle is fast, at the end is fast
Associative containers :::
    All operations are fast but the random access is slow

Derived conatainers :::
    fast or slow depends.
